Here is an example on how to use the OpenCV camera calibration methods. It includes a program to generate a checkerboard pattern for calibration. To build it you need CMake. Just do 

tar -zxvf calibrator.tar.gz 
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake .. 
make

Now you should have two programs in the build folder.
